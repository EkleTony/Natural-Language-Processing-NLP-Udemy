# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Udemy

Natural language processing (NLP) is the relationship between computers and human language. More specifically, natural language processing is the computer understanding, analysis, manipulation, and/or generation of natural language (according to dictionary.com).

Natural language refers to speech analysis in both audible speech, as well as text of a language. NLP systems capture meaning from an input of words (sentences, paragraphs, pages, etc.) in the form of a structured output (which varies greatly depending on the application). Natural language processing is a fundamental element of artificial intelligence.
